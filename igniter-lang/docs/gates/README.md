# Igniter-Lang Gates

## Purpose

Gate documents record formal authorization decisions that permit production
binding of capabilities that are otherwise closed by policy.

Gate requests are authored by `[Igniter-Lang Meta Expert]`.
Gate decisions are made exclusively by `[Architect Supervisor / Codex]`.

A gate request does not open the gate. Only a gate decision document does.

## Gate Lifecycle

```text
research proves boundary semantics (proof-local, report-only)
  -> Meta Expert authors gate request document
  -> Architect Supervisor reviews and decides
  -> Architect records gate decision document (approve / restrict / redirect / hold)
  -> Implementation authorized within approved scope only
```

## Active Gates

| Gate | Status | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| Gate 2 — descriptor metadata | ✅ ratified | Metadata-only descriptor package exposure; no live binding |
| Gate 3 — live TBackend / executor | approved-restricted | Phase 1 implementation only; live reads pre-live blocked; no Ledger/BiHistory/cache |

---

## Gate 3 Status

```text
Gate 3 scope: live Ledger/TBackend read-write-replay, runtime executor, production cache
Gate 3 state: APPROVED-RESTRICTED-PHASE1

Request: runtime-temporal-executor-gate3-request-v0.md
  Proposed restricted scope: live TEMPORAL History[T] valid_time evaluation only
  Excludes: BiHistory, stream/OLAP executor, Ledger write, production cache
  Decision: approved-restricted-phase1

Decision: gate3-decision-record-v0.md
  Authorized: Phase 1 TEMPORAL History[T] valid_time executor implementation
  Adapter: proof-local or non-Ledger abstract TBackend only
  Authority: architect-supervisor://igniter-lang/gates/gate3/runtime-temporal-executor/restricted-history-valid-time-v0/2026-05-09
  Pre-live: blocked until composition, observation, scope-exclusion errata,
    AT-1..AT-12, and regression proof chain pass
  Phase 2: real Ledger-backed adapter requires explicit Architect addendum

Safety review: gate3-decision-safety-pressure-v0.md
  Verdict: PROCEED
  Finding: no hidden authorization leaks; no blocker for Phase 1 implementation
  Follow-up: non-blocking wording amendments landed in decision record

Phase 1 prep review: phase1-implementation-prep-safety-pressure-v0.md
  Verdict: PROCEED for proof-local Phase 1 prep
  Finding: no live-eval, Ledger, BiHistory, or production-cache leak
  Still blocked before production/live reads: C4 ordering, AT-2 executor
    composition integration, AT-9 authority_ref URI comparison, regression chain
```

## Gate 3 Follow-Up Boundaries

| Follow-up | Status | Rule |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Phase 1 authority URI wording | landed | Phase 1 may embed the trusted authority URI as a constant until a registry exists |
| Runtime preflight ordering | open before production | Preserve canonical approval-token-before-gate ordering unless an explicit PROP-030 errata changes it |
| AT-2 executor/report integration | open before production | Phase1TemporalExecutor must consume the composed CompatibilityReport shape before `runtime_enforced: true` enters `lib/` |
| AT-9 authority_ref comparison | open before production | Token `authority_ref` must exactly match the decision URI before production Phase 1 live reads |
| Runtime authority registry | not defined | Required before Phase 2 / production authority-revocation work; not a Phase 1 blocker |
| Real Ledger adapter/package binding | closed | Requires explicit Architect addendum after Phase 1 |
| BiHistory / transaction-time | closed | Requires separate gate; cannot be added by quiet Phase 1/2 addendum |
| Production cache | closed | Requires separate approval; proof-local cache does not imply production memoization |
