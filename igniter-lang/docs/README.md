# Igniter-Lang Research Index

Status: active research index

## Claim

Igniter-Lang should be explored as a separate language ecosystem, not as an
implementation detail of the current Igniter platform.

## Active Tracks

| Track | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [tracks/observable-contract-language-v0.md](tracks/observable-contract-language-v0.md) | proposal | Completed first axiom slice for "everything observable, everything contract" |
| [tracks/observable-spine-v0.md](tracks/observable-spine-v0.md) | proposal | Completed minimal observation envelope and packet-kind spine |
| [tracks/failure-observation-v0.md](tracks/failure-observation-v0.md) | proposal | Completed structured failure packet model over the observation spine |
| [tracks/semantic-domain-reconciliation-v0.md](tracks/semantic-domain-reconciliation-v0.md) | done | Reconciled practical tracks with META-001 and PROP-001 formal corrections |

## Active Proposals

See [proposals/README.md](proposals/README.md) for the full index.

| Proposal | Status | Author | Summary |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| [proposals/META-001](proposals/META-001-compiler-grammar-expert-entry.md) | proposal | `[Igniter-Lang Compiler/Grammar Expert]` | Entry assessment + meta-corrections to existing tracks |
| [proposals/PROP-001](proposals/PROP-001-semantic-domain-v0.md) | proposal | `[Igniter-Lang Compiler/Grammar Expert]` | Formal semantic domain: V, T, Tt, C, Expr, O, F |
| [proposals/PROP-002](proposals/PROP-002-contract-composition-algebra-v0.md) | proposal | `[Igniter-Lang Compiler/Grammar Expert]` | Contract composition: >>, \|\|, branch, over, embed — algebraic laws + closure theorem |

## Core Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [ecosystem-split-proposal.md](ecosystem-split-proposal.md) | Defines the Igniter vs Igniter-Lang split |
| [research-process.md](research-process.md) | Research lifecycle, document rotation, handoff protocol |
| [agent-motion.md](agent-motion.md) | Current multi-agent movement and handoff routing |

## Research Vectors

- Observable Contract Language
- Everything Is Contract
- Organic Axiom Layer
- Agent-Friendly Language
- Persistence / Temporal Semantics
- Contract Synthesis
- Igniter Bridge
- Formal Semantic Domain (NEW — PROP-001)
- Contract Composition Algebra (ACTIVE — PROP-002)
- Grammar Fragment Classification (QUEUED — PROP-003)
- Type System v0 (QUEUED — PROP-004)

## Review Cadence

The research agent should produce compact completed slices. `[Architect
Supervisor / Codex]` periodically reviews a complete slice and then either:

- approves the direction
- narrows the next experiment
- rejects a branch
- requests a bridge note back to Igniter platform
