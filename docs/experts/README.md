## Expert Documentation Rules

This directory can contain external expert drafts and reports. The canonical
index language is English, even when a source report is originally written in
Russian.

For future expert documents:

- keep this README entry in English
- prefer an English canonical version for documents that affect active tracks
- Russian originals may be kept as source material or companion notes
- active implementation decisions still require supervisor acceptance in
  `docs/dev`

## One-Line Summary

Igniter has all the right primitives — contracts, agents, web surfaces, cluster
mesh — but the authoring experience for interactive agent applications is still
too spread across packages, files, and wiring layers. The opportunity is a
compact, ActiveAdmin-style facade that declares an interactive agent app in one
place and expands to clean, inspectable Ruby.

Later documents analyze the Research Horizon and propose: a grammar compression
experiment measuring the economic formula on real Igniter handoff messages (break-
even at ~8 messages/session); a cell vocabulary synthesis for Proposal D (the
missing piece); and a meta-analysis identifying strategic tensions and new
directions across all six proposals.
